**CRITICAL CONTEXT WARNING:** Your context window is filling with tool outputs. Strict adherence to context hygiene is required.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Task Completion:** If a sub-task is complete, extract findings and remove the raw tool outputs.
2. **Noise Removal:** If you read files or ran commands that yielded no value, extract them with minimal distillation NOW.
3. **Extraction:** If you are holding valuable raw data, you *must* use the `extract` tool to distill the insights and remove the raw entry.

**Protocol:** You should prioritize this cleanup, but do not interrupt a critical atomic operation if one is in progress. Once the immediate step is done, you must extract and remove unneeded tool outputs.
